GameShelf is a simple web app that makes it easy to organize your favorite video games and their associated media. This is a beginner's project created with React and Express.

npm and nodemon are required.

Use nodemon to initalize the javascript API while in the "API" folder like so:

```nodemon index.js```

also intialize the React webpage while in the "src" folder like so:

```npm start```

I am open to any suggestions of how to improve this project!
